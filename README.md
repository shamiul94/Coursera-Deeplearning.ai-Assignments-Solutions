# Coursera-Deeplearning.ai-Assignments-Solutions
My week-by-week solutions to the assignment problems of Coursera Deep Learning course instructed by The Legend himself Andrew NG. This consists of 5 different courses. I am enjoying every bit of this course. I hope you enjoy it too. 
I will solve these problems over the course of at least two months or so. I will update them here once I solve them. And I can't ensure to solve these problems serially as I need to learn some topics at first.
You can find the course [here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

# Note
As it is a paid course of Coursera, I have no right over the content in this repository. I am just solving these problems which are public on my own and I am not reliable for any of these content. No license is given in this repository either.
