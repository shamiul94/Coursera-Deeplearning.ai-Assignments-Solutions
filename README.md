# Coursera-Deeplearning.ai-Assignments-Solutions
My week-by-week solutions to the assignment problems of Coursera Deep Learning course instructed by The Legend himself Andrew NG. I am enjoying every bit of this course. I hope you enjoy it too. 
I will solve these problems over the course of at least two months or so. I will update them here once I solve them. And I can't ensure to solve these problems serially as I need to learn some topics at first.
You can find the course [here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).
